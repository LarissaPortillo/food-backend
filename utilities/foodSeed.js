    ingredients:[
        {a:2.25, m:'tsp',i: 'active dry yeast'},
        {a:1.5, m:'cups', i:'warm water'},
        {a:1.5, m:'cups', i:'white sugar'},
        {a:1, m:"tsp", i:"salt"},
        {a:2, m: "large", i:"eggs"},
        {a:1, m:'cup', i:'evaporated milk'},
        {a:6.5, m:'cups', i:'bread flour'},
        {a:1/4, m:'cup', i:'shortening'},
        {a:1, m:'quart', i:'vegetable oil for frying'},
        {a:.25, m:"cup ",i:`confectioners’ sugar`}
    ],
    instructions:
    `{1.In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar and yeast and stir. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes.
        2. Meanwhile, in a standalone mixer, combine the eggs, evaporated milk and salt and beat until combined.
        3. With the mixer on low, add in the yeast mixture to the egg mixture.
        4. Then add in 3 cups of the bread flour and mix on low.
        5. Add the shortening in and continue to mix before adding the remaining 3 1/2 cups bread flour. DON’T over mix!
        6. Knead the dough until smooth (it shouldn’t be stiff). Then place back in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
        7. Set the bowl in a warm area and let it rise for 2 hours.
        8. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4″ thick. Then slice into 2″ squares with a pizza cutter.
        9. Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven until the temperature reaches 350 degrees. Or you can be like me and just wait until it’s pretty hot ; )
        10. Then place a few dough squares in the hot oil and watch the magic happen! Turn them so they don’t burn on one side.
        11. When you remove them, dust with a light layer of powdered sugar, until all of them are done, then pile powdered sugar on top! And don’t be shy!!`,
